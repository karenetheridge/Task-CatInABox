Task::CatInABox - Catalyst and related modules for exploring Catalyst

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This distribution defined a set of modules to cover common modules used
in Catalyst applications.

This package is used by L<Perl::Dist::CatInABox> to produce a standalone
Catalyst installer for Win32, but is made available seperately so that
others can update their installations to match the same module set.

The "Catalyst in a Box" module collection is curated by Kieren Diment
E<lt>zarquon@cpan.orgE<gt>, please contact him regarding the list of
modules and to request additions.
